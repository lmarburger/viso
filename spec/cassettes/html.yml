It stood\n      on its own and looked out over a broad spread of West Country farmland.\n      Not a remarkable house by any means\xE2\x80\x94it was about thirty years old,\n      squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front\n      of a size and proportion which more or less exactly\n      <strong>failed</strong> to please the eye.\n    </p>\n  </body>\n\
